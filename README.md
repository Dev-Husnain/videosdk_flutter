## Key Concepts

---

- `Meeting` - A Meeting represents Real time audio and video communication.
  **`Note : Room and Meeting are same thing.`**
- `Sessions` - A particular duration you spend in a given meeting is a referred as session, you can have multiple session of a particular meetingId.
- `Participant` - Participant represents someone who is attending the meeting's session, `local partcipant` represents self (You), for this self, other participants are `remote participants`.
- `Stream` - Stream means video or audio media content that is either published by `local participant` or `remote participants`.

## Android Permission

---

Add all the following permissions to AndroidManifest.xml file.

```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

    <!-- Needed to communicate with already-paired Bluetooth devices. (Legacy up to Android 11) -->
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"
        android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"
        android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

    <!-- Needed to communicate with already-paired Bluetooth devices. (Android 12 upwards)-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

```

## iOS Permission

---

Add the following entry to your Info.plist file, located at `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

<br/>

## Token Generation

---

Token is used to create and validate a meeting using API and also initialise a meeting.

🛠️ `Development Environment`:

- For development, you can use temporary token. Visit VideoSDK [dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys) to generate temporary token.

🌐 `Production Environment`:

- For production, you have to set up an authentication server to authorize users. Follow our official example repositories to setup authentication server, [videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples)

> **Note** :
>
> The expiry of development environment token lasts 7 days only.

<br/>

## API: Create and Validate meeting

---

- `create meeting` - Please refer this [documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/create-room) to create meeting.
- `validate meeting`- Please refer this [documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/validate-room) to validate the meetingId.

<br/>

## [Initialize a Meeting](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/initMeeting)

- You can initialize the meeting using `createRoom()` method. `createRoom()` will generate a new `Room` object and the initiated meeting will be returned.

```js
  Room room = VideoSDK.createRoom(
        roomId: widget.meetingId,
        token: widget.token,
        displayName: widget.displayName,
        micEnabled: widget.micEnabled,
        camEnabled: widget.camEnabled,
        maxResolution: 'hd',
        defaultCameraIndex: 1,
        notification: const NotificationInfo(
          title: "Video SDK",
          message: "Video SDK is sharing screen in the meeting",
          icon: "notification_share", // drawable icon name
        ),
      );
```

<br/>

## [Mute/Unmute Local Audio](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/mic-controls)

---

```js
// unmute mic
room.unmuteMic();

// mute mic
room.muteMic();
```

<br/>

## [Change Audio Device](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/switch-audio-output)

---

- The `meeting.getAudioOutputDevices()` function allows a participant to list all of the attached audio devices (e.g., Bluetooth and Earphone).

```js
 // get connected audio devices
 List<MediaDeviceInfo> outputDevice = meeting.getAudioOutputDevices()
```

- Local participant can change the audio device using `switchAudioOutput(MediaDeviceInfo device)` method of `Room` class.

```js
// change mic
meeting.switchAudioOutput(mediaDeviceInfo);
```

- Please consult our documentation [Change Audio Device](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/switch-audio-output) for more infromation.

<br/>

## [Enable/Disable Local Webcam](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/camera-controls)

---

```js
// enable webcam
room.enableCam();

// disable webcam
room.disableCam();
```

<br/>

## [Switch Local Webcam](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/camera-controls)

---

```js
// switch webcam
room.changeCam(deviceId);
```

<br/>

## [Chat](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/pubsub)

---

- The chat feature allows participants to send and receive messages about specific topics to which they have subscribed.

```js
// publish
room.pubSub.publish(String topic,String message, PubSubPublishOptions pubSubPublishoptions);

// pubSubPublishoptions is an object of PubSubPublishOptions, which provides an option, such as persist, which persists message history for upcoming participants.


//subscribe
PubSubMessages pubSubMessageList = meeting.pubSub.subscribe(String topic, Function(PubSubMessage) messageHandler)


//unsubscribe
meeting.pubSub.unsubscribe(topic, Function(PubSubMessage) messageHandler);


// Message Handler
void messageHandler(msg){
  // Do something
  print("New message received: $msg");
}
```

<br/>

## [Leave or End Meeting](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/leave-end-meeting)

---

```js
// Only one participant will leave/exit the meeting; the rest of the participants will remain.
room.leave();

// The meeting will come to an end for each and every participant. So, use this function in accordance with your requirements.
room.end();
```

<br/>

## [Listening for Room Events](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/room-class/events)

---

By registering callback handlers, VideoSDK sends callbacks to the client app whenever there is a change or update in the meeting after a user joins.

```js
    _meeting.on(
      Events.roomJoined,
      () {
        // This event will be emitted when a localParticipant(you) successfully joined the meeting.
      },
    );

    _meeting.on(Events.roomLeft, (String? errorMsg) {
      // This event will be emitted when a localParticipant(you) left the meeting.
      // [errorMsg]: It will have the message if meeting was left due to some error like Network problem
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.recordingStarted, () {
      // This event will be emitted when recording of the meeting is started.
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.recordingStopped, () {
      // This event will be emitted when recording of the meeting is stopped.
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.presenterChanged, (_activePresenterId) {
      // This event will be emitted when any participant starts or stops screen sharing.
      // [participantId]: Id of participant who shares the screen.
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.speakerChanged, (_activeSpeakerId) {
      // This event will be emitted when a active speaker changed.
      // [participantId] : Id of active speaker
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.participantJoined, (Participant participant) {
      // This event will be emitted when a new participant joined the meeting.
      // [participant]: new participant who joined the meeting
    });

    _meeting.on(Events.participantLeft, (participantId) => {
      // This event will be emitted when a joined participant left the meeting.
      // [participantId]: id of participant who left the meeting
    });

```

<br/>

## [Listen for Participant Events](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/participant-class/events)

---

By registering callback handlers, VideoSDK sends callbacks to the client app whenever a participant's video, audio, or screen share stream is enabled or disabled.

```js
  participant.on(Events.streamEnabled, (Stream _stream) {
    // This event will be triggered whenever a participant's video, audio or screen share stream is enabled.
  });

  participant.on(Events.stereamDisabled, (Stream _stream) {
    // This event will be triggered whenever a participant's video, audio or screen share stream is disabled.
  });

```

### App Behaviour with Different Meeting Types

- **One-to-One meeting** - The One-to-One meeting allows 2 participants to join a meeting in the app.

- **Group Meeting** - **_COMING SOON_**
